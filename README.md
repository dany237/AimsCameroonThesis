This project estimates the cost of data breaches by predicting the number of compromised records using a Random Forest machine learning model. We analyze the "fat tail" phenomenon to understand the dynamics of affected records and calculate the maximum potential loss, crucial for assessing cyber risk insurability. Our findings reveal that the total number of affected records follows a Frechet distribution, and we estimate the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) parameters to determine the value at risk (VaR). This analysis offers a novel approach to understanding and managing cyber risks from a financial perspective, with valuable implications for businesses and insurers.
